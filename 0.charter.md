# Hex Charter v0 Draft 0
2025-06-03T00:49:00Z

NOTHING IN THIS DRAFT DOCUMENT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A LEGAL CONTRACT, INVESTMENT OFFER, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OBLIGATION. THIS IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT RELY ON IT FOR ANY LEGAL OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS.

# Preamble

How might a group decide? A simple method is to crown a monarch. Republics, democracies, councils, and corporations have attempted to realize a better system, to varying degrees of success. The ***Open Company*** continues that long tradition. 

An Open Company is similar to a corporation but differs in key ways. The company is open; formal and binding decisions are made publicly. Instead of powerful figures making key decisions behind closed doors, Open Company leaders vote publicly on decisions. An extended version of this system could allow for secret votes and decisions, but important decisions that affect the entire company should remain open. Instead of holding shares, *members* possess ⬡ (Hex+), which may not be sold/transferred. Over time, ⬡ produces ⬢ (Pure Hex). ⬢ can be used influence company decisions ***or*** sold for cash. Members must weigh whether to use ⬢ to exert power over company decisions or to make money. By making power come at a cost, the most powerful members become the ones willing to sacrifice the most. Leaders must build consensus if they'd like to implement their vision without sacrificing their paycheck.

Hex Theory LLC is a company owned by Paul Johnecheck and JP DiBella. To enact this Charter and transform Hex Theory into an Open Company, they must transfer ownership of Hex Theory into an irrevocable trust called the Hex Trust. The Hex Trust's beneficiaries will be all players of Hex Theory games and all contributors to Hex Theory's success. For now, the Trust is to be managed by an elected Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for managing the *ledger* and faithfully adhering to the rules set out in this charter. The Trustee must accept and publish all valid ledger entries. They must not abuse loopholes or ambiguities to subvert the charter. The specific rules of the Hex Trust and the precise obligations of the Trustee will be provided in a later version of this document.

The system should later expand to a board of trustees. Today, trust is essential to ensure that this monetary/voting system is managed faithfully. This vulnerability could eventually be mitigated with the help of cryptography, a blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs. In the meantime, trust will suffice. The threat of appeal to the American legal system will help too.

# Definitions:
- **User**:
  - A user is anyone with a Hex Theory account.
  - Users have a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier). `cb824d1d-63ef-4d75-b25f-5376ad0859bf` is a UUID.
- ⬣ (Hex)
  - This is the user-facing currency that all Hex Theory products are priced in. To buy Hex Theory products, users must first buy Hex.
  - In the UI, users can see both the price of a product in Hex and the price in USD (or other currency). The exchange rate between ⬣ and USD may vary.
  - The price of ⬣ is determined by an open market. Anyone with ⬣ can offer it at the price of their choice.
  - This open market is managed by the Hex Trust. All users should be able to buy/sell ⬣.
  - Ideally, its slowly appreciates and has low volatility.
  - Users may also speculate by buying ⬣ and not spending it on the products. This is not recommended.
  - ⬣ (and ⬢, ⬡, ⬡-) are discrete. It's impossible to spend/acquire fractional ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, or ⬡-.
- ⬢ (Pure Hex)
  - A special form of ⬣ that can be used for voting.
  - Can be used as ⬣ to buy products.
  - When sold/transferred, this downgrades into regular ⬣.
  - This distinction helps prevent overwhelming outside wealth from taking control of the company. (The Billionaire Attack)
- ⬡ (Hex+): ⬡ passively generates ⬢ at a rate of 1/hour.
  - A member who owns 20⬡ has an income of 20 * 24 = 480⬢/day.
  - In some ways it can be thought of as ownership stake in Hex Theory, but not exactly.
  - The ⬢ is generated at the beginning of the hour (UTC). A user with 1⬡ might have 0⬢ at 9:59:59 and 1⬢ at 10:00:00.
- ⬡- (Hex Minus): A downgraded form of ⬡.
  - ⬡- only produces ⬢ if it's owner is *charging* it.
  - To charge ⬡-, a member pays Hex Theory LLC an amount of money specified by the current [charge rate](#charge-rate-update). This charge rate is a quantity of USD that the member must pay weekly to keep their ⬡- charging.
  - Since Hex Theory product are only priced in ⬣, members charging ⬡- is Hex Theory's revenue.
    - Since this revenue should ideally match expenses, Hex Theory should make next to no profit. Proceeds from sale of Hex Theory products is distributed across all members when they sell ⬢.
  - See the following Ledger Entry types for more details.
      - [Charge](#charge) Sets a member's current charging level.
      - [Discharge](#discharge) allows members to voluntarily downgrade their current charging level.
- **Resource** 
  -  ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, and ⬡- are resources.
- **Member**: 
  - A user that holds at least 1 ⬡ or ⬡- is a *member* of Hex Theory.
  - Members can create *ledger entries*. By creating an entry, a member might vote, sell ⬣, propose new rules, etc. 
  - In a future decentralized version of this system, member identity is tied to a cryptographic key.
- **The Ledger**:
  - Each file in the `HexLedger` directory is a Ledger Entry. 
  - This file, `0.charter.md`, is the first. It's a Charter Overwrite, indicated by code 'charter'.
  - Filenames will count up (`1.vote.json`, `2.proposal.md`, etc)
  - Ledger Entries should *never* be deleted or modified. The Ledger is immutable.
  - Each member of Hex Theory should keep their own independent copy of the ledger.
      - Right now, this is a git repository that you clone. 
      - Later this could be a blockchain. 
  - Each member must verify that all entries are valid and should reject all that are not.
      - Manually for now, programmatically later. 
  - Every ledger entry should include the datetime of its creation. All datetimes should be formatted as an ISO 8601 string. (2025-06-03T00:49:00Z)
  - There are several kinds of ledger entries, each with a filename code.
  - See [Entry Types](#entry-types) for the full description of each kind of entry.
- **Voting**
  - A few key entry types constitute the voting system.
  - **Proposal**:
    - Contains a ledger entry that will be enacted if the proposal succeeds.
    - Members can vote with ⬢ for or against. When voting ends, that ledger entry is created if there are more ⬢ for than against.
  - **Vote**:
    - A quantity of ⬢ for or against a specific proposal.
    - The ⬢ is consumed when the vote is cast.
    - Can contain a comment as explanation/reasoning. 
  - **Conclusion**:
    - There are many ways to write the rules for how votes end. Here's a simple one for now, this should be updated later.
    - If at any point a [Conclusion](#conclusion) condition is met, any user may create a Conclusion entry. If the proposal passed, the proposed entry is then added to the ledger.
    - Conditions:
      - Consensus - All eligible members have voted in favor of a Proposal. 
      - Time - 7 days have passed since the creation of the Proposal.
    - **Risk** - If someone is trying to pass a malicious proposal, they might try to dump ⬢ on it at the last second. This can be prevented by allocating more ⬢ against than the bad actor has access to, passing proposals that fine/kick them, or upgrading the conclusion system. 

# Balance Calculation
This section formalizes the above definitions of ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, and ⬡- for lawyers and programmers. Other readers may want to skip to [the next section](#contracts-breaches-and-judgment).


To calculate a user's current balance in a given resource (⬣, ⬢, ⬡, ⬡-), follow the algorithms described below. 
Each algorithm processes the Ledger entries in chronological order, applying the rules defined for each entry type.
We assume that the ledger entries are all valid. Invalid entries should be rejected and not processed.

## Hex (⬣), Hex+ (⬡) and Hex- (⬡-)

1.  A user's ⬣, ⬡, or ⬡- balance starts at 0.
2.  Process every entry in the `HexLedger` directory in chronological order. For each entry, check if it affects the user's balance based on its type:
    - **`balance_update.json`**
        * For each item in the `changes` array where the `user` matches the user whose balance is being calculated, add the `delta` amount to the balance of the specified `resource` (⬣, ⬡, or ⬡-).
    - **`transfer.json`**
        - **Outgoing Transfer**: If the `from` user matches the user being calculated and `resource` is `⬣`, subtract the `quantity` from the user's ⬣ balance.
        - **Incoming Transfer**: If the `"to"` user matches the user being calculated, add the `quantity` to the appropriate balance based on the resource type:
            - If the `resource` is `⬣`, add the quantity to the user's `⬣` balance.
            - If the `resource` is `⬢`, add the quantity to the user's `⬣` balance (⬢ converts to ⬣ upon transfer)


## Pure Hex (⬢)

1.  A user's `⬢` balance starts at `0`. The `last_update_timestamp` starts at the datetime of the first entry in the ledger.

2.  Process every entry in the `HexLedger` directory in chronological order. For each entry, perform the following steps:
    - **Accrue Generated ⬢**
      - First, determine the user's `generating_balance` for the interval.
        - Calculate the user's `⬡` balance and `⬡-` balance by processing the ledger up to (but not including) the current entry. See [above](#hex-⬣-hex-⬡-and-hex--⬡).
        - Determine the user's `charge` level and the system `charge_rate` from the ledger state at the `last_update_timestamp`.  See [Charge](#charge), [Discharge](#discharge), and [Charge Rate Update](#charge-rate-update)
        - The number of active `⬡-` is `floor(charge / charge_rate)`. This value may not exceed the user's `⬡-` balance.
        - The `generating_balance` is the sum of the user's `⬡` balance and their active `⬡-`.
        - Next, identify the hourly payouts that occurred during this interval.
          - Determine the `next_payout_time` by taking the `last_update_timestamp` and rounding up to the next hour.
          - While this `next_payout_time` is less than or equal to the current entry's datetime:
            - Add the `generating_balance` to the user's `⬢` balance.
            - Increment `next_payout_time` by one hour.

    - **Apply Entry-Specific Changes**: After all payouts for the interval are complete, check the current entry's type and apply any direct changes to the user's `⬢` balance.
        - **`balance_update.json`**: For each item in `changes` affecting the user's `⬢`, add the `delta` to their `⬢` balance.
        - **`proposal.md`**: If the user is the proposer, subtract the current `proposal_cost` from their `⬢` balance.
        - **`vote.md`**: If the user is the voter, subtract the quantity of `⬢` they voted with from their `⬢` balance.
        - **`transfer.json`**: If the user is the `from` party and the `resource` is `⬢`, subtract the `quantity` from their `⬢` balance.

    - **Update Timestamp**: Finally, set `last_update_timestamp` to the `datetime` of the current entry.

3.  To get the balance at the present moment, perform one final accrual calculation for the time interval between the `last_update_timestamp` of the final entry and now, using the same hourly payout loop.

# Contracts, Breaches, and Judgment

Hex Theory is capable of entering into contracts and breaching them. 
Imagine the following scenario:


Hex Theory passes the following [resolution](#resolution): 
```markdown
# Resolution - Monetary Limits
2025-06-08T00:45:00Z
Without explicit permission from a user, Hex Theory will never remove ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, or ⬡- from that user.
```

Next, users and members make decisions with the understanding that Hex Theory will not use the power of [balance_update.json](#balance-update) to delete their holdings. (This is consideration, a key element of a contract under US law)

Then, Hex Theory passes a resolution using [balance_update.json](#balance-update) to delete user holdings. 

This is an obvious case of breach of contract. What happens next?

In the simplest version of this system, this is where the user should appeal to the US legal system. As with any breach of contract, the injured party should sue the breaching party in a court with appropriate jurisdiction. The judge might order Hex Theory to pay damages and/or update the ledger to repair the damage done by the illegal proposal. 

Lawsuits are expensive and slow. While liability and lawsuits are an unavoidable possibility as an entity under US law, they should be a rare measure of last resort. To make legal action less frequent, the system should provide a faster way to determine whether a given proposal is illegal. In a future version, we could allow any member could create a *Challenge* entry to raise the question of the legality of a given proposal. There should be some mechanism that disincentivizes frivolous challenges. Options for how to decide whether to sustain or overrule a challenge are discussed below. 

- The Judge 
  - We could introduce an elected position tasked with determining the legality of a given proposal.
  - When a proposal is challenged, the Judge would create a *Decision* entry with their decision.
  - If the challenger disagrees with the decision and believes they have standing, they can appeal this decision by suing Hex Theory in the appropriate court.
  - The relationship between the Judge and the US legal system is roughly analogous to the relationship between a district court and higher courts. Like a district court, the Judge's decision should be enough in most cases.

- The Panel
  - Like the Judge, but expanded to a panel of 3 or more judges. This better distribution of judiciary power reduces the odds of malicious or incorrect rulings. 
  - Judge votes would be recorded in the ledger.

- The Jury
  - An elected judiciary has some downsides. Subjecting legal interpretation to politics could go awry. 
  - A randomly chosen jury could be convened in response to a challenge. This jury could then vote on the result. 
  - The jury should be incentivized to decide faithfully.
    - One method might be to have juries stake some small quantity of ⬢. Jury members vote privately and lose their stake if they vote against the majority. This lost stake could then be distributed among the majority, incentivizing them to accept the jury role in the first place. 




# Entry Types
Entry types with a ⬢ next to their name can only be created via a successful proposal.

## .md
The second line in all markdown files must be the entry datetime.

### Charter Overwrite
- May only be created via successful [Proposal](#proposal).
- File code: `charter.md`
- Provides a new charter that replaces this charter in its entirety. This old document is no longer in effect and the new document becomes the new Hex Charter.
- Format by line:
  - 1: `# Hex Charter vX`
    - May be followed by an optional title.
    - Version numbers start at zero and count upwards. (v1, v2, ...)
  - 2: The datetime
  - 3+: The new charter.
- Example: this document
- The first charter is a special case in that it is the only Charter Overwrite not to be passed by proposal.

### Proposal 
- File code: `proposal.md`
- Format by line: 
    - 1: `# Proposal: [title]`
    - 2: The datetime.
    - 3: New UUID. This will be the Proposal ID. 
    - 4: UUID of the proposing member.
    - 5+: Optional explanation of the proposal.
    - n: The file code of the proposed entry.
    - n+1: The proposed entry enclosed in a markdown code block.
- Proposals can only be created by members. A member must spend X ⬢ to create a proposal. 
- The initial value for X is 1, but this value may change via a [Proposal Cost](#proposal-cost) entry.

```markdown
# Proposal: Normal Business Decision
2025-06-04T00:32:00Z
cb824d1d-63ef-4d75-b25f-5376ad0859bf
0cbdde43-822d-47c2-94dd-b2b9d9cb1d39

Just some run-of-the-mill proposal. Nothing to see here.

charter.md
```markdown
# Hex Charter v{X} - {datetime}

Member 0cbdde43-822d-47c2-94dd-b2b9d9cb1d39 makes all decisions.
.```
```
^Note: that `.` would be removed. It's there to make the formatting work.


### Vote 
- Begins with 
- File code: `vote.md`
- Format by line: 
    - 1: `# Vote: [title]`. 
    - 2: the datetime
    - 3: `[X] for` or `[X] against`. 
        - X is the quantity of ⬢ the member is spending on this vote. Once voting ends, this ⬢ will be lost forever. 
        - The vote is invalid if the user has insufficient ⬢. 
    - 4: UUID of the proposal being voted on.
        - The voting member must be eligible to vote on this proposal. 
    - 5: UUID of the user creating this vote.
    - 6+: The vote may then include an explanation in the form of markdown text.

```markdown
# Vote: OH NO YOU DONT
2025-06-04T00:45:00Z
1 against
cb824d1d-63ef-4d75-b25f-5376ad0859bf
1125efc2-3e25-4619-a313-a7f462ffe9c1

# GUYS THIS ISN'T A NORMAL BUSINESS DECISOIN AT ALL HE'S TRYING TO TAKE OVER
```

### Resolution
- May only be created via successful [Proposal](#proposal).
- File code: `resolution.md`
- Along with [charter.md](#charter-overwrite), this entry type is the voice of Hex Theory. 
- Any statement about what Hex Theory will do, must do, may only, etc. forms a binding contract between Hex Theory and all people with consideration. See [Contracts](#contracts-breaches-and-judgement) for more information.
- Format by line:
  - 1: `# Resolution - [title]`
  - 2: The datetime.
  - 3+: Resolution body.

Note: this just an example and is ***not*** a passed resolution that would legally bind Hex Theory . 
```markdown
# Resolution - Monetary Limits
2025-06-08T00:45:00Z
Hex Theory will never remove ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, or ⬡- from any user, except in the following cases:
  - A resolution might obligate Hex Theory to provide a user with ⬣, ⬢, ⬡, or ⬡-. That same resolution may provide for specific cases where those resources can be taken away. The resources removed in this way must not exceed the resources the resolution obligates Hex Theory to provide to that user. 
    - For example, a resolution might constitute an employment offer. If Hex Theory offers a user 100 ⬡- in return for labor, the contract should also describe valid reasons for dismissal. If the user is fired for gross misconduct, Hex Theory should then reduce their ⬡- holdings by 100. Reducing the user's ⬡- holding by 105 would not be allowed in this case, since the original resolution only offered 100 ⬡-. Similarly, Hex Theory may not reduce that user's ⬢ holdings, even if they were generated by that ⬡-.
```

```json
{
        "datetime": "2025-06-05T12:00:00Z",
        "proposer": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-1234567890ab",
        "rate": 0.01
}
```

### Charge
- May only be created via successful [Proposal](#proposal).
- File code: `charge.json`
- Sets a member's current charge. A member with charge is generating ⬢ from their ⬡-. A member's charge is denominated in USD, meaning that the number of ⬡- producing ⬢ is determined by the charge divided by the current charge rate.
- This entry is intended to indicate that a member is paying Hex Theory LLC to charge their ⬡-. It should be created after Hex Theory receives the first payment of the amount indicated by `charge`. After this payment, the member is expected to continue paying that charge amount at weekly intervals. They have the option to voluntarily stop paying at any time, which will be recorded in a [Discharge](#discharge) entry. If the member fails to make the next payment within 7 days and does not discharge, Hex Theory should propose and pass another Charge entry to forcibly downgrade their charge level.
- Charge (and the member's charge level) is used to calculate the amount of ⬢ a member is generating from their ⬡-. The current charge level of a member should accurately reflect the amount USD they are paying Hex Theory LLC to charge their ⬡-. Hex Theory is obligated to accept these payments (within reasonable restrictions on method) and pass a Charge Proposal to ensure that the member receives the correct amount of ⬢.
- Must be a valid JSON object containing:
    - "datetime": The entry datetime in ISO 8601 format.
    - "proposer": The UUID of the member who authored the successful proposal.
    - "user": The UUID of the member whose charge level is being set.
    - "charge": How much the member is paying Hex Theory to charge their ⬡- in USD per week.

    - `datetime`: The entry datetime in ISO 8601 format.
    - `user`: The UUID of the member whose charge level is being set.
